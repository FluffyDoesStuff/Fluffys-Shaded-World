<strong>THIS IS NOT A RAY-TRACED SHADER</strong>

This is a shaderpack I've been working on for a bit. I's being updated pretty frequently.

This shaderpack is open source and can be edited. Please do not take and reupload this as your own. (That's stealing. You wouldn't want to do that would you?)

If you have any questions about this shaderpack look at the website this shader is shown on: https://fluffydoesstuff.github.io or DM me on Discord if you can't find the information you're looking for. Fluffy#7973
